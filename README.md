# Twitch-streamers
Use the Twitchtv JSON API to build an app allowing to:

User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
